# Language Detection with Naive Bayes

This project demonstrates how to use the Naive Bayes algorithm to detect the language of a given text. The dataset contains sentences in various languages such as English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, and Portuguese.

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Converts text to numerical features using CountVectorizer.
- **Language Classification**: Uses Multinomial Naive Bayes for language detection.
- **Evaluation**: Calculates accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
- **Custom Predictions**: Allows testing with custom text inputs.
